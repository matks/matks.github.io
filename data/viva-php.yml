            7 years ago, when I was finally parting ways with PHP to focus solely on Java, I was among the PHP haters.
            So, maybe it's time to give PHP another shot?
            Now, in the last quarter of 2021 we have PHP 8.1 and Symfony 6.0.
            Both with innumerable improvements and new features.

            Welcome, dear reader! If you're reading this, you're probably one of the many people who find themselves wondering
            how much of what they've heard about PHP (a lot of which isn't super positive,
            I'm sure) is still relevant today. Is PHP a dying language?
            Should you learn PHP in $CURRENT_YEAR, and/or use it to build your next app?
            Hopefully, by the end of this post, you'll have the answers to these questions and more.

            If you’re scratching your head wondering why PHP isn’t dead or even dying, it’s likely because
            you probably don’t understand a few things about programming,
            programmers, markets, and democracy. Things that actually have nothing
            to do with code, functions, or syntax.

            PHP has a terrible reputation because it used to be horrible.

            Now as expected whenever talking about PHP on the Internet, people are quick to grab 
            their pitchforks and rehash the same classic criticisms of PHP over and over like a mantra.
            Is it to feel superior? Do they think they're doing a public service?
            I don't know. What I do know is that they're right to some extent;
            PHP isn't the best-designed language by any means, largely because
            it changed organically and incrementally over time.
            It certainly hasn't stopped PHP from becoming as popular as it has.

            Pour moi PHP représente tout la dynamique du web, et pour preuve, c’est le rare qui tienne encore debout
            et qui ait autant de popularité depuis 25 ans. Je ne parlerai pas de Go, qui a sa côte de popularité,
            mais tout frais, ou de Javascript qui a engendré NodeJS qui pour moi est plus une mode.
            Javascript n’a son intérêt qu’en front-end, à mes yeux.

            Among the many strategic decisions a business needs to make, one which we as developers
            are involved with is the choice of tech stack—the tools and technologies used for software development.
            When choosing a backend language, PHP presents its list of strengths and weaknesses;
            this article examines these from a business perspective.

            PHP is the most widely used language in the world for websites. It is also the most hated.
            And it’s pure hate. But why do so many developers hate it so much?
            Today we’re going to the origin of the hate, let’s see if it’s really justified.

            Much like the old stereotype of “only nerds play video games”, PHP definitely earned a few
            unflattering labels many years ago. Times have changed and developers in the know tell a very
            different story. Just like all the cool kids now play Fortnite (do they? I don’t know),
            PHP is nearly unrecognisable from its days as the scripting language ‘Personal Home Page’.

            Do you remember the popular "PHP: a fractal of bad design" blog post? The first time I read it, I was working in a crappy place with
            lots of legacy PHP projects. This article got me wondering whether I should just quit and go do something entirely different than programming.
            Luckily for me I was able to switch jobs shortly thereafter and, more importantly, PHP managed to evolve quite a bit since the 5.* days.
            Today I'm addressing the people who are either not programming in PHP anymore, or are stuck in legacy projects.

            What a small web-based business needs, no matter how big you think you will eventually get, is LAMP.
            For those who don't know, LAMP is an acronym defining your operating system, web server, database,
            and programming language. In this case, Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. If you are a business oriented
            founder or senior non-technical leader and you rely on others to advise you on technology,
            you have likely heard LAMP (specifically the PHP or MySQL part) is passe, not good enough, "too simple,"
            and doesn’t have the performance you need. That is complete nonsense. Facts...

            PHP has a bad reputation among many programmers — some of them because of the language’s past mistakes, lack of standardization, security issues, and code styling.
            That’s why new programmers don’t see PHP as an valid option for developing their projects.
            For your information, PHP 7 has overcome so many past issues and improved speed.
            Now PHP is insanely fast and has type hinting for methods and return types, making the language more consistent.

            It’s well known that PHP is a dead programming language and that its 22-year-old ecosystem is effectively
            useless now that we have Node and its fancy new asynchronous frameworks. Node’s superiority is evident
            because everyone knows that single-threaded, asynchronous, programs are better by default.
