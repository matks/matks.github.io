As a maintainer of several open source projects for now 3 years, I regularly meet people, mostly about an open source contribution. This allows me to experience all kinds of interactions. Most of them are collaborative and great, and keep me thrilled to work in open source. But some of them are spoiled by common beliefs or preconceived ideas about open source. So I'd like to bust one today.
