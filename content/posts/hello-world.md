A few weeks ago I decided to open a blog. Here it is !

<!--more-->

I have learned very valuable insights from reading
developers blogs such as [Pascal Martin](https://blog.pascal-martin.fr/)
and I hope to help fellow developers as well with this blog.

In the beginning I thought about using a standard CMS like Wordpress, but it was
too big for my need, I wanted something lighter. I tried a few blogging tools like
[Dropplets](https://github.com/Circa75/dropplets) but I was not happy with
the result so in the end I built it myself.

The structure of this blog is:
- [MarkdownBlogBundle](https://github.com/matks/MarkdownBlogBundle)
for the data structure, it does not need a database, only YAML anf Markdown files
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the front
- wrapped in a Symfony application

It has been a long time since I did not write CSS as I am a backend developer.
It was fun and rewarding to do some frontend stuff again. Having to choose
a host and setup the server was new to me too. In the end building this blog
was a very profitable project.

Special thanks to [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) for the awesome
[blog Bootstrap template](https://getbootstrap.com/examples/blog/) I am using.

_Note: in 2023 I rebuilt this blog so this content is not accurate anymore. The new blog uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Geekblog](https://hugo-geekblog.geekdocs.de/)._
